########################

#######################
# On/Off Switch
#
# ================
# This boolean property gives you the ability to disable
# Introscope AutoProbe by settings the property value
# to false.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

introscope.autoprobe.enable=true


#######################
# Custom Log File Location
#
# ================
# Introscope AutoProbe will always attempt to log the changes
# it makes.  Set this property to move the location of the
# log file to something other than the default.  Non-absolute
# names are resolved relative to the location of this
# properties file.
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property take effect.

introscope.autoprobe.logfile=../../logs/AutoProbe.log


#######################
# Directives Files
#
# ================
# This property specifies all the directives files that determine
# how Introscope AutoProbe performs the instrumentation.  Specify
# a single entry, or a comma-delimited list of entries. The list
# may include any combination of:
#    - directives (.pbd) files
#    - directives list (.pbl) files
#    - directories that will be scanned about once per minute for
#      .pbd files. Directives files placed in a listed directory
#      will be loaded automatically, without any need to edit this
#      Agent profile. If dynamic instrumentation is enabled, the
#      directives will take effect immediately without an app reboot.
# Non-absolute names will be resolved relative to the location of
# this properties file.
# IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a required parameter and it MUST be set
# to a valid value.
#    - If the property is not specified or the values are invalid,
#      the Introscope Agent will not run!
#    - If the property is set to include a directory, and invalid
#      directives files are placed in the directory, AutoProbe
#      metrics will no longer be reported!
#    - If the property is set to include a directory, and loaded
#      directives files are removed from the directory, AutoProbe
#      metrics will no longer be reported!
# You must restart the managed application before changes to this property
# take effect. However, if the property includes one or more directories,
# and dynamic instrumentation is enabled, the Introscope Agent will load
# directives files from the specified directories without an app restart,
# as noted above.

# Logging Configuration
#
# ================
# Changes to this property take effect immediately and do not require the managed application to be restarted.
# This property controls both the logging level and the output location.
# To increase the logging level, set the property to:
# log4j.logger.IntroscopeAgent=VERBOSE#com.wily.util.feedback.Log4JSeverityLevel, console, logfile
# To send output to the console only, set the property to:
# log4j.logger.IntroscopeAgent=INFO, console
# To send output to the logfile only, set the property to:
# log4j.logger.IntroscopeAgent=INFO, logfile

log4j.logger.IntroscopeAgent=INFO, logfile

# If "logfile" is specified in "log4j.logger.IntroscopeAgent",
# the location of the log file is configured using the
# "log4j.appender.logfile.File" property.
# System properties (Java command line -D options)
# are expanded as part of the file name.  For example,
# if Java is started with "-Dmy.property=Server1", then
# "log4j.appender.logfile.File=../../logs/Introscope-${my.property}.log"

# DNS lookup configuration
#
# Agent has following DNS lookup implementations: direct and separateThread.  Implementation to use is specified
# by value of introscope.agent.dns.lookup.type property.
# direct performs DNS lookups in application thread. Application thread will be delayed by length of time the
# underlying DNS mechanism takes to perform a specific lookup.
# separateThread performs DNS lookups in a separate thread. The application thread is delayed at most by
# introscope.agent.dns.lookup.max.wait.in.milliseconds milliseconds.
# When using separateThread implementation, if lookup of host name by IP address times out, IP address will be returned
# in place of name and if lookup of IP address by host name times out, empty IP address will be returned.
# Default DNS lookup implementation is separateThread

# Parameter introscope.agent.synthetic.header.names defines name(s) of HTTP headers that indicate a synthetic

# are not detected.  If multiple values defined, they are checked in order until a header is found which has
# non-null, non-empty value.  The header value will be used to create synthetic transaction name (and thus node
# name(s) under which metrics for the transaction) as follows:
# If header name is 'lisaframeid', the transaction name 'CA LISA' will be used.  If header name is anything other
# than 'lisaframeid' or 'x-wtg-info', value of header (with appropriate modification to ensure node name is valid)
# will be used as synthetic transaction name.  If header name is 'x-wtg-info', the header value is expected to
# contain sequence of attributes as name, value pairs separated by ampersands symbols.  Attribute name and value
# within each pair, are separated by equals sign.  The values of 'group', 'name', 'ipaddress' and 'request_id'
# attributes, separated by '|', are used to form synthetic transaction name.   For example the x-wtg-info header:
# clear synthetic=true&instance=ewing&name=sample&group=SampleGroup&version=4.1.0&ipaddress=192.168.193.1&sequencenumber=1&request_id=start&executiontime=1226455047
# would result in metrics being reported under node 'SampleGroup|sample|192.168.193.1|start'.  Any attributes which are

#  Transaction Structure aging properties
#
# ================
# This property is to evaluate the number of elements in the transaction structure at the period interval,
# to determine if "emergency aging" is required.
# Default value is "30000"
# com.wily.introscope.agent.harvesting.transaction.creation.checkperiod=30000

# This property specifies the period in milliseconds that the aging for the transaction structure is checked,
# Default value is "30000"
# com.wily.introscope.agent.harvesting.transaction.aging.checkperiod=30000

# This property specifies the minimum amount in milliseconds that a tree in the transaction structure must be inactive before it is purged.
# The inactivity does not imply that it will be aged out.
# Default value is "60000"
# com.wily.introscope.agent.harvesting.transaction.aging.period=60000

# This property sets the maximum percentage increment in the size of the structure that is allowed to happen before aging of the transaction structure is forced
# If the change in the number of nodes between the aging periods is more than this percentage value, then checking for aging occurs
# if set to a small value, the transaction structure will be aged more frequently, and the memory utilization of the agent will be therefore
# kept lower.
# Default value is "5", i.e. 5%
# com.wily.introscope.agent.harvesting.transaction.aging.attentionlevel.percentage=5

# This property sets the maximum absolute increment in the size of the structure that is allowed to happen before aging of the transaction structure is forced

# kept lower.
# Default value is "100000"

# This property is used to avoid spikes in memory utilization of the transaction structure.
# If there is an increase of elements at any time bigger than a third of this value,
# then "emergency aging" occurs immediately. Emergency aging will agent parts of the transaction structures that are younger than the
# value specified in com.wily.introscope.agent.harvesting.transaction.aging.period,  and will likely reduce the amount of data sent by the agent.
# Only modify this value if the memory requirement are very strict.
