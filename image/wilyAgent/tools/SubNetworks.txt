# This file defines sub networks and is used by agent to weight importance of network interfaces.  Interfaces in the networks
# defined here will have lower priority when it comes to choosing the primary network interface.

# File format.  Line consists of simple text lines.  If line contains #, the # and rest of line is discarded as comment.  Next
# any trailing spaces are discarded.  Any empty lines are also discarded.  Remaining lines are assumed to start with either
# 'private' or 'tunnel' then one or more whitespace characters followed by sub net specified in the form of <IP ADDRESS>/<RANGE>.
# Where <IP ADDRESS> is either IPv4 or IPv6 address (though only sub net portion of address is required), if address contains
# any colons, it is assumed to be in IPv6 format, otherwise it is assumed to be in IPv4 format.  The <RANGE> is an integer
# number indicating the number of bits in the subnet address.  For example 10/8 indicates the subnet starting at 10.0.0.0
# and which requires sub net mask of 255.0.0.0.
